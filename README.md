A study guide for pre-work.

## Decription 

This study guide was made to help me study information that will be essential during my time in the coding bootcamp.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

First I began my project installing all necessary software that would be needed to code.
Next I began with HTML coding in order to build the bones of the project and add any information that I would like to display in the project.
Then I used CSS to add the color and other details to the study guide.
Finally I used JavaScript to give the page the option to interact with it and check the code from the browser.
